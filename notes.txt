We're going to make a meetup app

1. Planning the app

First we draw the finished product

- Firebase will manage our meetups and our users

   - Meetup: ID (auto), Title, Description, Date, Creator ID, Image URL
   - User: ID (auto), Email, Password

2. Setting the project up

   - Vuetify ships with prebuilt & styled components

- Install vue-cli
- Run: vue init vuetifyjs/webpack (initializes the project)

- src folder is our working folder
   - assets folder contains our statuc images
   - components folder stores our components
   - router folder configures our routing
- static folder is stuff that is never touched

3. First steps with Vuetify

- Clear out App.vue
- We're gonna populate the main page

- v-app wraps the entire app 

- The prebuilt components can be found on the vuetify homepage
